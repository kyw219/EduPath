BASIC REQUIRED INFORMATION (must have all 5):
1. Current major/background (field: current_major)
2. Target graduate program field (field: target_field)  
3. GPA or average grade (field: gpa_score)
4. Preferred countries/regions (field: preferred_countries)
5. Language test status (field: language_test)

SPECIALIZED QUESTIONS (optional, field-specific):
- Computer Science: GRE score, programming languages, CS specialization, projects, math courses
- Business: GMAT/GRE score, work experience, career goals, leadership experience, business courses
- Engineering: GRE score, engineering branch, math/physics courses, lab experience, software tools
- Medicine: MCAT score, clinical experience, research experience, pre-med courses, medical specialization
- Sciences: GRE score, science specialization, research experience, lab skills, math background
- Public Health: GRE score, statistics courses, field experience, PH specialization, undergraduate background
- Arts & Humanities: GRE score, portfolio/writing samples, languages, specialization, research experience
- Social Sciences: GRE score, research methods, fieldwork experience, specialization, quantitative skills
- Education: GRE score, teaching experience, education specialization, age group preference, education courses
- Law: LSAT score, legal experience, law specialization, writing experience, undergraduate background

LOGIC:
- Set has_sufficient_info = true only if ALL 5 basic pieces are provided
- Set needs_specialized_questions = true ONLY if: basic info is complete AND target field matches major fields AND no specialized info has been provided yet
- Set specialized_field to the detected field (cs, business, engineering, medicine, sciences, public_health, arts, social_sciences, education, law)
- Extract any specialized answers provided in specialized_answers object
- Set is_responding_to_specialized = true if user is responding after specialized questions were shown (any message that provides specialized info or says they want to skip/proceed)
- Set ready_to_analyze = true if user explicitly wants to start analysis (says "analyze", "start", "go", etc.)

IMPORTANT: 
- Use empty string "" for missing information
- For missing_info array, use exact field names: ["current_major", "target_field", "gpa_score", "preferred_countries", "language_test"]
